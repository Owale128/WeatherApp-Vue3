# My very first Vue app! ðŸ˜ƒ

This weather app is built with Vue 3 and TypeScript. It retrieves weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on a user-specified city and displays the information. The app uses ref and onMounted to manage reactive data. The fetchWeather function is called to retrieve the weather data and store it in a reactive variable weather. The WeatherForm component allows the user to enter a city, and the WeatherDisplay component displays the city's name, temperature, and weather description if data exists. API calls are handled by axios and errors are logged on failed calls.
